#The .csv files contain the following information:

1. I : training set consisting of mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide frequencies of S/MAR sequences from SMARtDB and their scrambled counterparts, taken as positives and negatives, respectively.

2. II : training set consisting of mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide frequencies of S/MAR sequences from SMARtDB and random CDS sequences of the species (Refseq & Genbank) represented in the SMARtDB database, taken as positives and negatives, respectively.

3. Sample1 : mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide frequencies of human S/MAR sequences sampled (10%) from MARome. 28,357 sequences.

4. Sample2 : mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide frequencies of 10,000 prokaryotic CDS sequences (Refseq).

5. Sample3 : mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide frequencies of 10,000 human CDS sequences.

6. Sample4 : mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide frequencies of 10,000 random CDS sequences of the species represented in the SMARtDB database, other than the ones used in training.
